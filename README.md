# OCR-Assitance-Assistant
Created in python a simple script that reads from an image to take assitance from meetings
This is really simple.
You just make sure to modify the name in the program to get the image from your directory.
It checks if it exists and then goes to an excel file and from a page extracts all IDs of people to be involved in the meeting and then checks from the obtained image if they were indeed there to add the information to an excel file.
